    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Student Learning Hub</strong> is a student-designed educational website created to support
      peer-to-peer learning in an engaging, organized, and accessible environment. The purpose of this
      platform is to provide students with a central space where they can connect with others, track
      their progress, and access meaningful learning resources beyond the traditional classroom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Designed by students, for students, the site focuses on usability, clarity, and motivation.
      Navigation and layout choices were intentionally structured to help learners quickly find what
      they need, whether they are scheduling tutoring sessions, reviewing study materials, or monitoring
      their own learning progress.
